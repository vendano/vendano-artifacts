# Vendano Catalyst Artifacts

Public artifacts for Vendano’s Catalyst-funded wallet onboarding initiative. This repository hosts evidence, analytics, and documentation generated during the project to support transparency, reproducibility, and community review. Artifacts are published to invite feedback, verification, and learning from the broader Cardano and open-source communities. Content is BSD 3-Clause licensed.

### Proposals overview

**Proposal A**: Onboarding-first, hashed-contact sending, iOS and Android apps. Emphasizes beginner onboarding, privacy-preserving contact lookups, and public artifact visibility focused on onboarding metrics.

**Proposal B**: Physical HOSKY/NFT Card Campaign (10 US cities). Mint NFT/HOSKY cards, seed onboarding with hashed contact data, drive app installs and first transfers, and provide LOIs, printing logistics, and a open‑data replication playbook for community reuse.

Both proposals share a similar artifact structure:

- 001/m1 `proposal 001, milestone 1`
- 001/m2 
- 001/m3
- 001/m4 `closeout`

Within each milestone: public artifacts such as evidence, analytics snapshots, parity matrices, security memos, test results, and open notes

Non-sensitive data only; aims for verifiability and replayability

There will be subfolders in each milestone folder, such as:

- evidence/
- analytics/
- parity-matrix/
- screenshots/
- closeout/
- video/

### How to review and contribute (high level)

- Inspect 001/m1 through 001/m4 for each proposal’s artifacts
- Propose changes, add missing artifacts, or request clarifications via PRs
- Ensure artifacts avoid exposing sensitive data and are clearly documented
